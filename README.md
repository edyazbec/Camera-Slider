# Camera-Slider
These are the files for a DIY motorized camera slider I created.

Required Parts:
  20mmx40mm extrusion of any length
  Microcontroller(Arduino)
  LCD display
  Stepper driver
  Stepper Motor
  KY-040 Encoder

The slider can be powered from 5-12V. See attached diagram for wiring.
This makes it easy to create simple motion time-lapse or hyper-lapse videos. To see the projects in more detail, watch my video (https://youtu.be/SSymOHEP6hk).
I printed all these parts in PETG, but any non-flexible material should work.
